# Data Management I (Data Profiling and Quality Dimensions) 

# Goal-A

a) Data Profiling
  - Using Talend Data Quality Management tool, you have to explain the data profiling steps
  performed on the dataset.
b) Data Cleaning
  - Mention all the relevant data quality dimension necessary for cleaning the dataset.
  - Present in detail the steps (recipe) performed for cleaning the dataset by applying the
  data quality dimensions. A systematic walkthrough of the recipe is expected.
  - OpenRefine, Talend Data Preparation, Tableau Data Prep, or Trifacta can be used for
  performing the data cleaning process.
  - The datasets can be in any format, exporting them in a DB system for performing
  specific/advance queries is up to each individual. However, this information should be
  seamlessly integrated into the presentation and highlighted where necessary.
  - Following are the mandatory questions that have to be answered for this goal:
  • What insights did you gain from this dataset profiling and cleaning?
  • Which all data quality dimension does your analysis fits into?
  - Explain the dimension with a user-story, the user-story can be hypothetical one
  created by you.
  - For example, in the classroom tutorial on the Patent dataset, the user-story was
  finding the different countries filing patents;
  - To answer this user-story, the dimensions conformity + consistency + accuracy
  was considered for the column “PublicationNumber”.
  
 Why did you choose a given technique and the associated steps for a task?
  - Is there an alternative technique that could have been
  
  
  # Goal-B
  - Creating a Raw dataset refereeing to any online source like kaggle.com.
  - Conditions on the Raw dataset
  o Minimum dimensions to be considered while making the dataset Raw are
  § Accuracy
  § Completeness
  § Conformity
  § Validity
  § Consistency
  § Uniqueness
  § Currency
  o You are free to include any other dimension from the Literature.
  - The dataset must be made at least 25% Raw/Unclean based on the above-stated
  dimensions. Make sure to mention how the 25% has been calculated after the
  uncleaning is performed.
  - Every record/set of records that you make unclean should be documented, highlighting
  the quality dimension that is considered.
  - The recipe/source-code should also be submitted for verification
  o You can use any or a combination of Excel, OpenRefine, Data Preparation,
  Tableau Data Prep, or Trifacta.
